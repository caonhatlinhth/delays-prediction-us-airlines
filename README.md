# delays-prediction-us-airlines

This project is aimed at analyzing the factors leading to commercial flight delays, specifically targeting small airlines. 
The goal is to analyze historical flight data from Carrier On-Time Performance Report (2018 â€“ present) on Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics (BTS) [1] to draw insights and eventually use this knowledge to develop a machine learning model that predicts the probability of flight delays.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- What is volume and percentage of arrival delays for each airline?
- Which are the most frequent routes with highest ratio of arrival delays?
- Which are the airports with highest ratio of arrival delays?
- How does the arrival delays ratio for intrastate flights compare to that of interstate flights?
- How do departure and arrival schedules influence arrival delays?
- Which is the most frequent reason for delay?
- Which is the most frequent reason for delay?

**Models Implemented:**

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Decision Tree
- AdaBoost

**Highlights:**

- Comprehensive data analysis of airline on-time performance.
- Feature engineering to enhance model accuracy.
- Comparative evaluation of model performance.
